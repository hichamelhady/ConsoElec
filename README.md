## Source of data: ENEDIS open data

Enedis is a public service company, which manage the electricity distribution network to more than 35 million client. It developes, implementes and modernise the electricity. It particularly works on data from electricity meters. With the energy transiton and the talks about smartcities and modernisation, ENEDIS created a website, in whcih they let free acces to their data.

The data is available is consisting of the eletricity consumption sorted by total number of people using it, regions and activity sectors. But also the sum of electricity production for many years sorted by the way of producuction (solar, hydraulic, Cogeneration or others)  

## Data visualisation - Goal of the project
Our work aim to help producers of energy, the users and also public function services to control their consumption of electricla energy and to predicte the amont of production basing on demand history for each region. To do this, we represented the data that we have in four ways : 

- Diagram of sankey representing the flow of electrical energy consumption in different sectors of activity sorted by regions

- Geomapping with a visualization of demography of each region and when we choose a region, an other graph appears to presesnts the energy consumption for the selected region, sorted by sector of activity for each unit.

- A grouped/stacked bar chart visualising the temporal evolution of the energy production in france.
