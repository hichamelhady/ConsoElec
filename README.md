## Data visualisation - source de données : ENEDIS

Enedis is a public service company, which manage the eclectricity distribution net. It develope, implimente and modernnise the electricity and provide the realted dates.

The data are available for us to use on their website, consisting of the average yearly eletricity comsommation that are sorted by total number, regione and activity sectors. 

## Data visualisation - Goal of the project
Our work aim to help update the data with the new intelligent visualisation interacting the the data. It mainly has 3 parts: 

- Diagram of sankey representing the flow of electrical energy consumption in different sectors of activity

- Geomapping with a visualization of energy consumption by region, by sector of activity

- Possibly a graph of the temporal evolution of the energy consumption for each region (at the click of the mouse)
